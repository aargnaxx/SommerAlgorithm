# Allele search algorithm
This is an implementation of the allele search algorithm described in [Sommer et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-542). 

This repository is a part of my thesis at the [University of Zagreb](http://www.unizg.hr/)'s [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](http://fer.hr/) titled *Comparison of Algorithmic Approach and Machine Learning for Grouping Similar DNA Sequences*.
